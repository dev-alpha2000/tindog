Overview
Tindog is a fun dog-matching app built using React. Similar to Tinder, this app allows users to swipe through various dog profiles to find the perfect match for their pets. Users can view profiles, swipe right to like, swipe left to pass, and potentially "match" with other dogs.

This project demonstrates key React concepts such as state management, conditional rendering, and interaction handling.

Features

Matching System: Get notified when thereâ€™s a mutual "like" between profiles.
Dog Profile Details: Each profile includes images, name, breed, age, and description.
